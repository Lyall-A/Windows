This is just setup for my fans and shit
Do NOT use Armoury Crate, I would rather kill myself
In L-Connect 3, turn off motherboard sync for RGB and RPM
Use OpenRGB Pipeline for RGB and Fan Control for (figure it out)
Download the Lian Li plugin for Fan Control (don't use the ARGB version)
In OpenRGB you can control the pump and fans using the detected Lian Li controllers
In Fan Control you can control each channel of the hubs, however I think the pump can only be controlled if motherboard RPM sync is enabled
Using motherboard sync means that you can't control each channel on your hubs, all sync ports will be the same and all the fans will be the same speed
So basically if you want as much customizability as possible then don't use motherboard sync
Theoretically this method would be good for Linux too
